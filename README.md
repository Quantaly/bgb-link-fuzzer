# bgb-link-fuzzer

A program that sends random data to the BGB emulator, designed primarily for use with Pokémon Red and Blue. [Based on this video by TheZZAZZGlitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhrIaCNYHrk).

## Instructions to recreate the video

1. Launch two instances of BGB. Load a ROM of Pokémon Red or Blue into each.
2. Link the two BGB instances normally.
3. Talk to the Cable Club receptionist first in the emulator you plan to link to the program.
4. Talk to the receptionist in the other emulator and enter the Colosseum.
5. Disconnect the emulated link cable and close out of the other emulator.
6. Make a save state (quick save defaults to F2). This will allow you to load back to this point (quick load defaults to F4) when the game inevitably crashes or hangs.
7. Start the program and connect to it from BGB.
8. Start a battle and watch as the glitchy madness ensues.
